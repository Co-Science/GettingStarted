## Dont Forget To Make It Public
After you join the repo , your org profile would be set to private by default just like this

![dontForgetToMakeItPublic](./img/dontForgetToMakeItPublic.png)

You can make them public by: 
- Navigate to [people's](https://github.com/orgs/Co-Science/people) tab from the Organization page 
- Choose your username from all the amazing people
- all you have to do now is to click `Private`(the default) and set it to `Public` and there you go .
